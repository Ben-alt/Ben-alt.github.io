                    <h3>DES cracker</h3>
                    <p>In 1990s EFF was worried that the US government was refusing to switch encryption methods.
                        The current method at the time, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Encryption_Standard">Data Encryption Standard</a>, was already shown to be possible to crack.
                        Thie caused the EFF to create a special machine designed to break DES, nicknamed Deep Crack.
                        The EFF succesfully lowered the time for cracking a DES message from 56 hours to under 24 hours.
                        In the next 4 years, as a result of the EFF's actions, DES had been replaced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">Advanced Encryption Standard</a>.

                    <h3>Legal cases</h3>
                    <p>The EFF has taken legal cases in order to make sure that the publics
                        internet freedoms are kept. The EFF will defend or bring lawsuits even 
                        standing against America's government or large companies. The first big
                        case that the EFF took was Steve Jackson Games, Inc. v. United States Secret Service. This case occured when
                        SJG was raided as an investigation of piracy. The secret service took many of the companies
                        floopy disk which contained their upcoming game GURPS Cyberpunk. This promply caused a lawsuit by SJG add
                        was the reason that the EFF was created. The EFF has then taken many
                        different court cases, many of which can be found <a href="https://www.eff.org/cases">here</a>.</p>

                    <p>The EFF runs a regularly updated <a href="https://www.eff.org/">blog</a> about updates in 
                    the privacy community. They often tell the their readers about current and future events that they should
                    be looking out for. In addition to this, they have many recomendations on what software to use 
                    in order to maintain privacy.
