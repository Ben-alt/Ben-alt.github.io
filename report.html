                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <img src="resources/infograph_public_privacy.jpg" width="500px">
                <p>Privacy, something that everyone agrees that everyone should have. Not everyone thinks that this applies to the digital world though, but I think that line of thinking is wrong. Everyone should have privacy on the internet. We're not even close to getting to it. With how easy it is for an outsider to track all your data, to how companies are collecting every single speck of data that you give to them. This report is being made to show all of these issues and how we, as a society could attempt to solve them. First let's go through some prerequisite knowledge. The Five Eyes are a group of countries who share intelligence with each other. This group consisted of Canada, US, UK, Australia, and New Zealand. There was leaked information of the Five Eyes spying on each other's citizens and sharing the information. The Five Eyes extends to bigger groups like the 10 eyes and 15 eyes. Common ways for hackers to track you are fingerprinting, through insecure networks, or malware. Fingerprinting is when the hacker uses your unique browser configuration, from your location to your browser extensions, which allows the hacker to track you and is very hard to detect. Public networks are not safe. A hacker can easily steal your data if you are connected to a public network, anything you type in is fair game. Malware is a program that can be harmful to the computer and this can be used to log passwords, install a backdoor, etc. Our objective is to make the internet a more private and safe place.

                <h2>Actions and Objectives</h2>
                <img src="resources/What-is-Internet-Privacy-and-what-does-privacy-mean-to-you-Dynamix-Solutions.jpg" width="500px">
                <p>It is important that someone takes action on this issue. As internet privacy doesn't seem like a large issue to some people. Many people think that they are already protected, as technology is advancing, nothing can track them. However, this is further from the truth. Everyone has already had their data collected by any website they have been to. This means there are a lot of people who are unaware of the true scale of the issue. This is one way someone could have a positive impact. They could educate others about the issue and how they could protect themselves. This can take many different forms. Including news articles, YouTube videos, infographic, or just telling your friends. These could teach people how to prevent yourself from being hacked and what tools they should use that wouldn't track their data. By educating these people we can remove the impact of the problem. If everyone follows the advice, the companies wouldn't have as much data to make money off of. There would also be less hacks as people would be more secure. A way to see if this method worked is to check statistics. For example, if the number of people who have a hacked account consistently goes down, then we know that the method worked.  Another reason someone would take action is to attempt to change the government. Some governments have not been doing enough to give people their internet privacy. People could take action against this by doing protests or petitions. As this issue is very large and the government is part of the problem, there would need to be severe pushback by the public in order for the government to change its laws. In order to see if this method works, you just have to see how the government responds. If they change the laws to how you would like it, it worked.</p>
                <h2>Recommendations</h2>
                <img src="resources/HEAD-CCPA_2C_GDPR_2C_and_the_State_of_Internet_Privacy_Laws_Hero.png" width="600px">
                <p>There are three things that I think should change. Firstly, governments should stop spying on the public. It has been known for a while that the government is tracking us. Through our internet history, text messages, facial recognition, and many many more. However, it would be better for the citizens if just did not happen. This. change would not happen unless we challenge the government. Through lawsuits, petitions, and suggestions, people can make the government change for the better. Secondly, force companies to have better storage for user information. When data breaches happen, the main reason that passwords are leaked is because the company has not properly stored. It can be encrypted or stored on a different server, it's not that difficult to do. However, Facebook one of the world's largest tech companies has admitted to having stored passwords in plain text. If one of the richest companies is slacking, clearly governments have to step in and make it mandatory for some sort of protection, as it would not only prevent hacked accounts, but lower identity fraud rates as well. Finally, I think that people need to be more knowledgeable about how to protect themselves. Many attacks only happen because people have bad habits. For example, using the same password for every account, or falling for phishing scams. By educating everyone on how to be anonymous, we could prevent may of these problems. One problem I have with the Canadian government is that they should be more transparent about their data collection. The government was very secretive about the Five Eyes Alliance and they should do better than that. By showing what they have collected and allowing the citizens to control their data, it would make the government appeal to the public and benefit the citizens. Another thing  should do is to create similar laws to the EU's GDPR. This would force the companies to be transparent to its consumers. This would be a major step towards allowing the public to have complete privacy. These two steps would be the first two major actions towards having privacy on the internet.</p>
