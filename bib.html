            <p>This site discusses internet privacy laws. Not only in one country, but around the world.
                It provides a brief summary of different laws around the world and links for further 
                reading. I think that this source is reliable because of it's many different authors.
                If you want to learn more about a certain law, it links to a more in detail article written by them.
                While this may seam untrustworthy, they use many different authors with a variety of backgrounds.
                The source is very objective in their statements, not really putting in subjective statements to 
                sway the reader. They only state the laws that the country has made. The site was updated very recently, the 
                last update being in July. I think that this site will be helpful in telling me what each countries of what laws,
                as a stepping stone for further research.

            <p>Privacytools.io goes through reasons to why you should care about internet privacy. It provides counter arguments towards the most common
                reasons that people say about why they don't care about internet privacy.
                 In doing this it also goes through software that you shouldn’t use and software that you should use.
                 I think that this source is reliable. The site is open source meaning that anyone can edit it, but it has to be approved
                 by the people that run the site. This means that the site should be accurate because of the sheer number of people that are 
                 changing the site for the better. The source is very objective in its thinking, citing many other sources to prove its point.
                 The objective of the site is to inform everyone and to do that, the contributors are consistently updating the site to keep up
                 with recent news. This is a very different site from the others ones I looked at because it not only states the facts, but also
                 tells the audience what they can do about it. I think that this source is helpful in my research, as it is a very good starting point
                 for facts that I should research further.
