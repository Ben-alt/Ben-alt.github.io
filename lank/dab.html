                Today was an ordinary day in the Research Department. Winston and I had a great talk about The Eleventh Edition. He doesn't understand the beauty of Newspeak, all he wants to do is speak the same old Oldspeak. Who needs words like splendid when we could just use doubleplusgood! I worked on removing some more words. You can't commit thoughtcrime if we reduce the size of people's vocabulary. No one will even have to think about what they say anymore. Imagine the time saved if we develop the dictionary that far. It would be simply amazing. Anyway, the rest of my day was normal. Nothing out of the ordinary.
