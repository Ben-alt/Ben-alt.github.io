            <p>Panic shook the city when a newborn baby was stuck in a burning building. Hearing the plead for help, local heroes Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford were nearby. They coincidentally had a ladder and managed to successfully save the baby from the burning building. The heros were on a business trip to New York for a business trip. When asked about why they had a ladder, they stated why not carry a ladder with you?</p>
