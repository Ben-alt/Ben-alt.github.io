            <li>All that I have been thinking about is that darn photo. I think the party is lying to me, but what can I do? I'm just one man vs the world at this point. I can't trust anyone with this information. I might get them killed or me killed. I'll wait till I'm sure there is a rebellion brewing. Then I'll just give them the evidence. They'll be able to use it to fight the party. The day that happens may be never, but I'll wait until then.
