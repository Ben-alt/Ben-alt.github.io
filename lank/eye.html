            <li>I had an odd talk today. O'Brien asked for a copy of the new newspeak dictionary. Why would he want that? He's never been interested in my dictionary. He's even said that newspeak will never replace the good ole oldspeak. Is he trying to tell me something? Oh, I see? Perhaps he's a part of the rebel resistance and he knows that I have the damning evidence. He wants me to give him the photos and newspaper, not the dictionary. That makes a lot more sense. I better go meet him next Tuesday.
