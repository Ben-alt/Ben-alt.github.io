                    <p>Panic shook the city when a newborn baby was stuck in a tree. Hearing the plead for help, local heroes Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford were nearby. They coincidentally had a ladder and managed to successfully save the baby from the tree. The heros were on a business trip to New York for "reasons." When asked about why they had a ladder, they stated why not carry a ladder with you?</p>

                They contradict each other. What blasphemy! The party never lies. The party is the truth. The photo must be made up, but why did someone give it to me? Is someone telling me something?
