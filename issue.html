                <p>Big companies are collecting all of our information. This is threatening our anonymity as they are
                collecting everything you do on the internet. Location, browsing habits, search history, etc. This allows the company or government
                to keep tabs on everyone and do whatever they want with this data (for example, sell it to other companies). This data can  also be
                vulnerable to hackers through interception or data breaches. This doesn't apply only to big companies, hackers can 
                easily collect your data. Through methods like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_fingerprint">
                fingerprinting</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_security"> browser exploitation,</a> it
                becomes trivial for anyone to collect information about you and your habits.
                <br><br>
                The statistics show that this issue has steadily growing over time. In 2014, there were 783 data breaches.
                In the short span of 4 years, this has doubled to a staggering 1,578. These leaks have many consequences,
                one of which being that identity fraud hit an all time high. In 2017, every 1 per 15 US customers were victims 
                of identity fraud. Not only identity fraud, but 21% of people said that they had an account that was hacked.
                <br><br>
                The hackers aren't the only one who take advantage of our data. Recently, Vermont created a new law requiring that companies that
                buy and sell user data dealing with residents to register with the Secretary of State. 
                Through this, it was found that 121 data brokers were operating in the United States. Each company has millions of user's data that they
                can use and that the customer has no control over. This is not even accounting the many companies which did not need to register.
                The scary thing about these companies collecting your data is that the big companies have admitted to it. Amazon has stated that 
                they hire hundreds of employees that listen to your Amazon Echo conversations. Facebook stores records on its consumers about everything,
                from account names, to reactions. Facebook did also store account passwords in plaintext format where all the employees could easily search
                through it.

                    <br>The government has also been shown to spy on their citizens. The Five Eyes(<a href="https://www.privacytools.io/classic/#ukusa">and 10 and 15</a>)
                    is an intelligence alliance that allows these countries to share data with each other. 
                    Edward Snowden leaked documents that show this group has been keeping an eye on a citizen of everyone of these countries.
                    It was shown that the Five Eyes did this to make sure that no constitutional laws were being broken.

                    <br><br>
                    "What many don’t realize is that the Five Eyes community is not just about intelligence sharing. The world is a big place and intelligence collection systems are, by their very nature, sensitive beasts. One country would not want to put its own technology into another sovereign state, and there is only limited collection that can be done from embassies. The Five Eyes network has portioned off the globe and agreed to collect on behalf of the other members. That intelligence is then shared. This means no one member can stop sharing with another without partially blinding themselves."
