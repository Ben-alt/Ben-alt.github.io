                Natural Selection
            </h1>
            <p>
                Have you ever wondered how the millions of different species on earth came to be?
                Well the answer is through evolution, or how a species changes over time.
                One of the main ways that evolution occurs is through natural selection.
                But
            </p>
            <h2>
                What is natural selection?
            </h2>
            <p>
                Natural selection is the process through which species adapt to the environment around them.
                This means that an individual's features like color and size, also known as traits,
                benefits them in their environment. This is known as an advantageous trait.
                Let's see this happening in a real environment, so it's time for you to meet Bob.

                Hi Bob!<br> <br>
                Bob lives on the nearby beach. Let's go!
            </p>
            <figure class="full">

            <p>
                Wait. What happened here since the last time I saw you Bob?
                Last time I saw many different colors of lobsters, but now you guys are all red.
            </p>
            <figure class="full">

            <p>
                Well why don't you tell me?
            </p>
            <h2>
                Why does natural selection occur?
            </h2>
            <figure class="full">

            <p>
                That's a lot of variation for that trait.
            </p>
            <figure class="full">

            <p>
                So the parents pass their traits to their children. This is known as heredity, but
                how did go from so many colors to only one though?
            </p>

            <p>
                Ah I see, so by because you could blend in with the beach more if you were red, this made
                being red advantageous.
            </p>
            <figure class="full">

            <p>
                So, because of parents pass their color to their childen, the color of lobsters became red over time. This is an example of natural
                selection occuring. Well, thanks for telling me that story Bob, and I hope you and your lobster friends can go back to being colorful
                without being eaten.
            </p>

                Giraffes used to be shorter. There would be variation in the giraffe's height, but all the food that was high up
                wouldn't be eaten by any other animal, so the giraffe's that were taller would get to eat more food. This means
                that the taller giraffe's would survive more often because they got to eat more food and this means that these giraffe's
                children would also be tall. This would repeat and over time the giraffe would become taller and taller.
            </p>

                Humans used something called pesticides to get rid of insects by killing them, but through natural selection insects
                can become resistant to pesticides. This is because only insects that are resistant to pesticides will live, allowing
                these insects to pass their traits that make them resistant to pesticides down to the next generation.
            </p>

                As you can see, natural selection has affected many animals and is a main reason to why we have so many different kinds
                and diverse animals on this planet.
