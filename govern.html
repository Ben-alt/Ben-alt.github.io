            <h1 class="title">What have governments done?</h1>
            <p class="dap">Privacy laws are usually controlled by the federal government,
                 but the provincial government has some control over more specific policies(e.g healthcare, employment).
                 In each country the department that handles these laws are different. In Canada it is the mainly the 
                 Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada that deals with privacy issues. The branches that control this issue
                 are mainly legislative and executive because making better laws and making sure no policies are broken is the big deal.
                 Judicial also deals with it sometimes do to lawsuits related to the privacy laws.

                <h3>United Nations</h3>
                <p>The UN has created the Principles on Personal Data Protection and Privacy. 
                    These principles are set as the basic standard for the handling personal data.
                    The UN's goal in making these principles are to standardize data control policies,
                    ensure that people have their right to privacy, and make it easier to accountably process peoples data.
                     However, like the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, it is not law that the countries have to implement these principles.
                </p>
                <h4>Is it sufficient?</h4>
                <p>I think the UN's actions are somewhat sufficient. While they have not made it law for these principles to be implemented,
                    making it law would take time away from more important issues like climate change. Even if they tried to make it law,
                    some countries would not agree with the principles and exclude themselves from the law. I think that the countries 
                    should be creating stricter laws on privacy. This would have more of an effect than if the UN enforced these principals.

                <h3>European Union</h3>
                <p>In 2018, the EU implemented the General Data Protection Regulation. 
                    The GDPR attempts to give individuals more control over their personal data for citizens in the EU or the 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Area">EEA</a>. 
                    Any organization based in the EU or dealing with citizens of the EU has to follow certain requirements.
                    <br>These requirements being:
                    <ol>
                        <li>The company must lay out all the data it is collecting about the consumer.</li>
                        <li>The company must receive consent from the customer to allow then to collect data.</li>
                        <li>Must have the personal information protected in some way(e.g. encrypted).</li>
                        <li>The company must inform the consumer of any data breaches that have happened.</li>
                        <li>If the customer wants their data to be deleted, the organization must comply</li>
                        <li>The company must have a data protection officer that is responsible for making the company follow GDPR regulations.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>If the organization does not follow these requirements, they may be hit by a fine of up to €20,000,000 or 4% of their total worldwide annual revenue of the preceding financial year.</p>
                </p>
                <h4>Is it sufficient?</h4>
                <p>Yes, I think the EU's actions are sufficient enough. By implementing these laws, it makes
                    the customer in control of their own data amd not the big companies. The EU has shown that 
                    they will fine large companies, as they have fined Google €50 million. Through these laws, the
                    EU has shown that they care for the consumer too and will support the customer.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p class="dap">Countries have their own specific laws on privacy, too many to list here.

            <h3 class="sub">What could they do better?</h3>
            <div class="dab">
            <p>I think that there are multiple things governments could do better:
                <ol>
                    <li>Be more transparent about what information they collect on people. The government was very secretive about this and information only came out when it was leaked</li>
                    <li>Make the companies be more transparent. Many countries should implement laws like the GDPR, as they vastly helps to implement the consumer's right to privacy.</li>
                </ol>
                By doing these things governments would gain the trust of the public and help the battle in the fight for privacy.
